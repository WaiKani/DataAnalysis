# Project- Capstone 2

For this challenge, you'll be assuming the role of a Data Analyst for Dano Airlines, a UK-based airline
headquartered in London, United Kingdom. The latest passenger survey results just came in, and it looks
like the satisfaction rate dipped under 50% for the first time. The leadership team needs to take
action fast, so they've brought you in to analyze the data and find the key areas to focus on for getting
back on track.

## About Dataset
Customer satisfaction scores from 120,000+ airline passengers, including additional information about
each passenger, their flight, and the type of travel, as well as their evaluation of different factors like
cleanliness, comfort, service, and overall experience.
Your task is to recommend a data-driven strategy for increasing Dano Airlines' satisfaction rate.
and present it in the form of a single-page report or dashboard.

## Results
![](https://github.com/WaiKani/DataAnalysis/blob/main/22.jpg)
From the first graph, we see that lack of satisfaction is high with Economy and Economy-plus, unlike business travel.
Second graph shows both business and personal travel are dissatisfied, whereas satisfaction is high for business compared to personal.
Arrival and departure delays are highly dissatisfying.
Males are more content than females 
Across the classes, both males and females are discontented in economy class, as previously shown in Graph 1.
Lastly, we see that returning travelers are the most disgruntled.

## Conclusion & Recommendation
Based on the above observations, the areas that Dano Airlines should focus on are: economy class, personal travel, delays in both arrival and departure, and possibly investigating why females are disgruntled.
Further areas to look at are: in-flight service, gate location, food and drink. The statistics for this were not available although they were scanned.
Further investigation is needed to determine why the economy class is not satisfied, considering they are often the most booked, unlike the business class.
This is backed-up by the personal travel results, thus this is an area to be studied in depth and find ways to boost the positive feedback. 
This could be something as simple as customer service, to name afew.
