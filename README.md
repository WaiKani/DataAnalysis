# Project- Capstone 2

Analyze as a Data Analyst for Dano Airlines, a UK-based airline headquartered in London, United Kingdom. The latest passenger survey results just came in, and it looks
like the satisfaction rate dipped under 50% for the first time. The leadership team needs to take action fast, so they've brought you in to analyze the data and find the key areas to focus on for getting back on track.

## About Dataset

Customer satisfaction scores from 120,000+ airline passengers, including additional information about
each passenger, their flight, and the type of travel, as well as their evaluation of different factors like
cleanliness, comfort, service, and overall experience.
Your task is to recommend a data-driven strategy for increasing Dano Airlines' satisfaction rate.
and present it in the form of a single-page report or dashboard.

## Results


![](https://github.com/WaiKani/DataAnalysis/blob/main/Capstone%2022.jpg)


From the first graph, we see that lack of satisfaction is high with Economy and Economy-plus, unlike business travel.
Second graph shows that both business and personal travel are dissatisfied, whereas satisfaction is high for business compared to personal.
Arrival and departure delays are highly dissatisfying.
Males are more content than females 
Across the classes, both males and females are discontented in economy class, as previously shown in Graph 1.
Lastly, we see that returning travelers are the most disgruntled.

## Conclusion & Recommendation

Based on the above observations, the areas that Dano Airlines should focus on are: economy class, personal travel, delays in both arrival and departure, and possibly investigating why females are disgruntled.
Further areas to look at are: in-flight service, gate location, food, and drink. The statistics for this were not available, although they were scanned.
Further investigation is needed to determine why the economy class is not satisfied, considering they are often the most booked, unlike the business class.
This is backed-up by the personal travel results, thus this is an area to be studied in depth and find ways to boost the positive feedback. 
This could be something as simple as customer service, to name a few.

## Employee Survey Responses 
The Employee Survey Responses are actual responses from an employee engagement survey conducted 
by Pierce County WA and completed voluntarily by government employees. The dataset is a Single table 
and contains 14,725 records. The total number of fields is 10. 
Analyze the dataset and provide answers to the questions listed below: 


## Question 1

Which survey questions did respondents agree with or disagree with most?

The only question respondents had to agree or disagree at varying degrees was: “I know what is expected of me at work,” and most were in agreement.

## Question 2

Do you see any patterns or trends by department or role?

Most questions were answered by the respondents. The line chart shows that most respondents were Supervisors and the least were directors. 


## Question 3

As an employer, what steps might you take to improve employee satisfaction based on the survey results?
![]()

As per the pie chart, most people agree that they know what’s expected of them. One can continue what the company is doing, but make changes to reduce the dissatisfaction. Considering most respondents were supervisors, one can go in depth to see where the disagreements are coming from; so that one can focus on them.


## Conclusion and Recommendation

From the questionnaire, we can establish that everyone was willing to answer questions and forthcoming. Postive results show that employees knew what was expected of them and worked towards that. 
In conclusion, more research needs to be done to see in each specific role if they actually know their expectations and discern if they need training or a change of training programmes they may already have.

# Shark Attacks

This is a dataset on Shark attacks reported over the past 100 years, including location, activity, victim info
(name, gender, age), shark species, etc.
You are contracted as a Data Analyst to help Global Superstore analyze and draw out meaningful insight
from the Superstore dataset which would aid management in making informed decisions to improve
performance and profitability.

Using skills learnt from the data Bootcamp, apply your knowledge of:
● Power Query
● Data Modeling
● Data Cleaning
● Data Visualization
● Knowledge of generating actionable insights etc.

## Question 1

Make a graph of the number of shark attacks annually over time since 1900. What trends do you see?


![](https://github.com/WaiKani/DataAnalysis/blob/main/Cap56%20(6).jpg)

We see a high number of cases at the beginning but numbers decreasing over the years.

## Question 2

Which countries report the most shark attacks? Within those countries, which areas and locations seem 
to be the most dangerous? 


![](https://github.com/WaiKani/DataAnalysis/blob/main/Cap56%20(4).jpg)


Austalia, USA and South Africa were found to have the highest shark attacks.
Australia had New South Wales, South Africa: Kwa-Zulu Natal and USA: Florida had the most attacks.

## Question 3 

What body parts are most often injured?

![](https://github.com/WaiKani/DataAnalysis/blob/main/Cap56%20(3)%20(1).jpg)

Body parts rarely injured was the face and body while leg, arm and foot appeared to be the most injured.

## Question 4

Are shark attacks more common during certain parts of the day?

![](https://github.com/WaiKani/DataAnalysis/blob/main/Cap56%20(2).jpg)

Attacks seem to happen mostly in the afternoon.

## Question 6 

Which species of shark are attacking most often? 

![](https://github.com/WaiKani/DataAnalysis/blob/main/Cap56%20(1).jpg)

The Great white seems to be the species that mostly attacks. 

## Conclusion & Recommendations
From the above findings, we see that shark attacks have been decreasing over the years, thus precautions implemented seem to be working to ensure they are kept to a minimum. Here one needs to look at the tools used and emphasize them. One can also look why there are more attacks in Australia South Africa or USA.

Many factors play a role on the information provided. For example, in Australia what species caused the most damage or even at any time. This can be applied to other areas and see if there is any correlation. The information above just raises the concern about the attacks, and more analysis or research is needed to look at each country in depth and see what can be ‘changed’ to reduce the numbers.
