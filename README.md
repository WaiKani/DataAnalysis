# Project- Capstone 2

Analyze as a Data Analyst for Dano Airlines, a UK-based airline headquartered in London, United Kingdom. The latest passenger survey results just came in, and it looks
like the satisfaction rate dipped under 50% for the first time. The leadership team needs to take action fast, so they've brought you in to analyze the data and find the key areas to focus on for getting back on track.

## About Dataset
Customer satisfaction scores from 120,000+ airline passengers, including additional information about
each passenger, their flight, and the type of travel, as well as their evaluation of different factors like
cleanliness, comfort, service, and overall experience.
Your task is to recommend a data-driven strategy for increasing Dano Airlines' satisfaction rate.
and present it in the form of a single-page report or dashboard.

## Results
![](https://github.com/WaiKani/DataAnalysis/blob/main/Capstone%2022.jpg)
From the first graph, we see that lack of satisfaction is high with Economy and Economy-plus, unlike business travel.
Second graph shows that both business and personal travel are dissatisfied, whereas satisfaction is high for business compared to personal.
Arrival and departure delays are highly dissatisfying.
Males are more content than females 
Across the classes, both males and females are discontented in economy class, as previously shown in Graph 1.
Lastly, we see that returning travelers are the most disgruntled.

## Conclusion & Recommendation
Based on the above observations, the areas that Dano Airlines should focus on are: economy class, personal travel, delays in both arrival and departure, and possibly investigating why females are disgruntled.
Further areas to look at are: in-flight service, gate location, food, and drink. The statistics for this were not available, although they were scanned.
Further investigation is needed to determine why the economy class is not satisfied, considering they are often the most booked, unlike the business class.
This is backed-up by the personal travel results, thus this is an area to be studied in depth and find ways to boost the positive feedback. 
This could be something as simple as customer service, to name a few.

## Capstone 4

## Employee Survey Responses 
The Employee Survey Responses are actual responses from an employee engagement survey conducted 
by Pierce County WA and completed voluntarily by government employees. The dataset is a Single table 
and contains 14,725 records. The total number of fields is 10. 
Analyze the dataset and provide answers to the questions listed below: 

![](https://github.com/WaiKani/DataAnalysis/blob/main/Capstone4.jpg)

## Question 1
Which survey questions did respondents agree with or disagree with most?

The only question respondents had to agree or disagree at varying degrees was: “I know what is expected of me at work,” and most were in agreement. 


## Question 2
Do you see any patterns or trends by department or role?

Most questions were answered by the respondents. The line chart shows that most respondents were Supervisors and the least were directors. 


## Question 3
As an employer, what steps might you take to improve employee satisfaction based on the survey results?

As per the pie chart, most people agree that they know what’s expected of them. One can continue what the company is doing, but make changes to reduce the dissatisfaction. Considering most respondents were supervisors, one can go in depth to see where the disagreements are coming from; so that one can focus on them.


## Conclusion and Recommendation
From the questionnaire, we can establish that everyone was willing to answer questions and forthcoming. Postive results show that employees knew what was expected of them and worked towards that. 
In conclusion, more research needs to be done to see in each specific role if they actually know their expectations and discern if they need training or a change of training programmes they may already have.
